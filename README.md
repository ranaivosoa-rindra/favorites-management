# favorites_management

A test project.

## Getting Started

Versions used the project: Flutter 3.0.5 and Dart 2.17.6

The main.yml file allows me and anyone who have this SECRET_TOKEN as a token to make the github workflow works.

With add to favorites methods, it's easy to use provider state management in order to share data between different screens, and add the data to favorites.
