# favorites_management

A test project.

## Getting Started

Versions used the project: Flutter 3.0.5 and Dart 2.17.6

The main.yml file allows me and anyone who have this SECRET_TOKEN as a token to make the github workflow works.

    - You can check out the list of products when you first open the app, and use the drawer in order to navigate between screens.

    - With add to favorites methods, it's easy to use provider state management in order to share data between different screens, and add the data to favorites.

    - Share feature: So when you click on the button , the social media I have used is gmail, when you click on its icon, you're able to share the product with his name.

    # Note: You need to wait some time before getting the product to the addresse (Mine it takes up to 5mn to 10mn) might depend to your internet connection too. Also, apparantly it looks like one user can send/share only 2 products.

    - Search feature: you can search in the search bar by the name of the product, its alcoolPercent or its manufacturer (accorinding to the listed data in the products_data.json).
