# favorites_management

A test project.

## Getting Started

Versions used the project: Flutter 3.0.5 and Dart 2.17.6

The main.yml file allows me and anyone who have this SECRET_TOKEN as a token to make the github workflow works.

    - You can check out the list of products when you first open the app, and use the drawer in order to navigate between screens.

    - With add to favorites methods, it's easy to use provider state management in order to share data between different screens, and add the data to favorites.

    - Share feature: So when you click on the button , the social media I have used is gmail, when you click on its icon, you're able to share the product with his name.

    # Note: You need to wait some time before getting the product to the addresse (Mine it takes up to 15mn to 30mn) might depend to your internet connection too.
